# Regex Engine â€“ A Custom Grep-like Tool

A fully custom-built regular expression engine written from scratch using **tokenization** and **Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)** â€” no reliance on existing regex libraries.  
Supports advanced features like **nested groups**, **backreferences**, **multi-line search**, and **recursive directory scanning**, making it function like a lightweight `grep` alternative.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **Custom Regex Parser**
  - Built tokenizer to break down patterns into tokens.
  - AST-based execution for flexibility and maintainability.
- **Advanced Pattern Matching**
  - **Nested Groups** â€“ e.g., `((\w+)\s+(\d+))` for complex pattern composition.
  - **Backreferences** â€“ e.g., `(cat) \1` matches `cat cat`.
  - **Escaped Shorthand Patterns**:
    - `\d` â€“ digits `[0-9]`
    - `\w` â€“ word characters `[A-Za-z0-9_]`
  - **Anchors** â€“ `^` and `$` for start/end of line.
  - **Quantifiers** â€“ `*`, `+`, `?`
  - **Character Classes** â€“ `[abc]`, `[^abc]`, ranges.
- **Search Capabilities**
  - **Simple input and pattern search**  
  - **Single file search**  
  - **Multi-file search**  
  - **Recursive directory search** with file filtering
- **CLI Tool**
  - Works like `grep` for fast terminal searches.

## ðŸ›  Architecture Overview

1. **Tokenizer (Lexer)**  
   Converts regex patterns into token streams (e.g., `(`, `\w+`, `)`, `*`, `\1`).

2. **AST Builder**  
   Constructs an abstract syntax tree from the token stream for structured evaluation.

3. **Pattern Matcher**  
   Executes the AST against input text using a backtracking algorithm.

4. **CLI Interface**  
   - Takes pattern + file(s) as arguments.  
   - Supports options like recursive search and multiline matching.

## ðŸš€ Example Usage

```bash
# Search for lines containing 'apple' in file.txt
./regex_engine -E "apple" file.txt

# Match words that start and end with the same word
./regex_engine -E "^(\w+) starts and ends with \1$" file.txt

# Recursive search for 'TODO' in a project folder
./regex_engine -r -E "TODO" ./src

# Find numbers followed by words
./regex_engine -E "(\d+)\s+(\w+)" notes.txt
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance
While not as optimized as `grep`, it demonstrates:
- **Efficient matching** for moderate file sizes
- Structured design for adding new regex features
---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project Matters
Most developers use existing regex libraries; this project shows **deep understanding of parsing, compiler theory, and algorithm design**:
- Lexer & parser implementation
- Tree-based pattern evaluation
- File I/O optimization for large searches
- Real-world CLI integration
